# YouTube Code Examples

Companion code for my YouTube programming tutorials.

## Playlists

| Playlist | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [AI-Driven Design Thinking](ai-driven-design-thinking/) | Design patterns and software architecture explored through AI-assisted development |

## How to Use

1. Find your video's playlist folder
2. Navigate to the episode folder (e.g., `ep02-dependency-injection/`)
3. Each episode has a README with setup instructions and context

## Running the Examples

Most examples are Python. To run them:

```bash
# Navigate to an episode folder
cd ai-driven-design-thinking/ep02-dependency-injection

# Run a specific file
python 01_bad_no_seam.py
```

No virtual environment or dependencies required for most examples—they're designed to be simple and self-contained.

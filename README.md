# YouTube Code Examples

Companion code for my YouTube programming tutorials.

## Playlists

| Playlist | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [AI-Driven Design Thinking](ai-driven-design-thinking/) | Design patterns and software architecture explored through AI-assisted development |

## How to Use

1. Find your video's playlist folder
2. Navigate to the episode folder (e.g., `ep02-dependency-injection/`)
3. Each episode has a README with setup instructions and context

## About the Examples

Most examples are Python code snippets designed to **illustrate concepts** from the videos. Many are not meant to be executed directly—they demonstrate patterns, show before/after comparisons, or highlight specific design decisions.

Future episodes will include fully executable examples where appropriate.

## Structure

```
├── playlist-name/

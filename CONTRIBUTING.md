# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in these examples!

## Purpose

This repository contains companion code for YouTube tutorials. The examples are designed to be **simple and educational**—not production-ready libraries.

## How You Can Help

### Found a bug or typo?

Open an issue! I appreciate reports of:

- Code that doesn't run
- Typos in comments or READMEs
- Broken links

### Have a suggestion?

Feel free to open an issue to discuss. I'm happy to hear ideas for:

- Clarifying confusing examples
- Adding helpful comments
- Improving documentation

### Pull requests

PRs are welcome for bug fixes and documentation improvements. For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss.

## What This Repo Isn't

This isn't a library or framework—it's learning material. I prioritize clarity over completeness, so please don't be surprised if examples are minimal or skip edge cases.

## Questions?

Leave a comment on the video or open an issue. Thanks for learning with me!

# 🧰 Production Instructions — Factory Episode Package

## Goal
Produce a friction-free, code-led video where **decisions migrate into a factory** and tests prove correctness.

## What to record
### A-roll (camera)
- Record only the lines marked **CAMERA** in `performance_script.md`.
- Keep takes relaxed; leave space for ad-lib after each anchor.

### Screen capture (silent)
- Record each file in the Shot List for **8–12 seconds**.
- **No scrolling during a shot.** Increase font size instead.
- Cursor: either hidden or deliberate.

## VS Code setup
- Font: 18–22
- Minimap: OFF
- Breadcrumbs: ON
- High contrast theme

## Edit recipe
1. Lay down A-roll.
2. Drop shots at the matching script sections.
3. Apply slow zoom/highlight per notes in script.
4. Add terminal “tests passing” beat near the payoff.

## Viewer clarity rules
- One shot = one idea.
- Three VO sentences max before a visual change.
- If you introduce a term, define it in one line and return to code.
